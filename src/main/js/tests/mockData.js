Without any big- hitting additions of hops in the boil, we carried the flavour by heavily dry-hopping the brew with Citra and Mosaic. We also used oats in the recipe to deliver the trademark smooth mouthfeel â€“ and made it truly authentic by propagating a one-off culture of Vermont yeast, specifically for the brew.",
